                    <ul class="liste">
                        <li><strong>1914</strong>- Born in Crescà, Iowa</li>
                        <li><strong>1933</strong>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                            Depression era program known as the "National Youth Adminidtration"</li>
                        <li><strong>1935</strong>- Has to stop school and save up more monry. Works in the Civilian Conservation
                            Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on
                            me". </li>
                        <li><strong>1937</strong>- Finishes University and takes a job in the US Foresrry Service</li>
                        <li><strong>1938</strong>- Marries Wife of 69 years Marget Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget scut.
                            Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who traches him about
                            breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                        <li><strong>1941</strong>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.
                            Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disintectants,
                            and other applied science.</li>
                        <li><strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                        <li><strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
                            flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his tram breeds 6,000
                            different strauns of disease resistent wheat-including different varieties for each major climate on
                            Earth.</li>
                        <li><strong>1945</strong>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                        <li><strong>1953</strong>- Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
                            creating a train that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                        <li><strong>1962</strong>- Visits Delhi and bring his high-yeidling strains of wheat to the Indian
                            subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                        <li><strong>1970</strong>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                        <li><strong>1983</strong>- helps seven African contries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields

                        <li><strong>2005</strong>- States "we Wille have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                            genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
                            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
                            animalsfor a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                        <li><strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95</li>
